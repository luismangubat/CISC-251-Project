# Presidential-Election-Predictor

Conceptual Complexity is to measure an individualâ€™s ability to project their ability to perceive a different perspective of a certain subject. 
Historically, lt has been seen that it is extraneous and time-consuming to manually score large sets of text. Therefore, there is a demand to 
automate scoring to significantly reduce time and expense. This paper suggests that using modern machine learning algorithms is a better predictor
than traditional methods specifically the efficacy of a presidential speech.
